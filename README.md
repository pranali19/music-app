# music-app
This React-based app leverages Spotify API's to facilitate previewing, searching, and other music-related activities.

 In addition to having Node.js installed on the system and a Spotify account, you will also need to obtain a Spotify Client ID and Secret Key by logging into the official website of Spotify API.
 
 * Client ID
 * Client secret
 * change redirect uri to "http://localhost:3000" if using locally
